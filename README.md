# A Snake game on RL
## How to use

### Run the *train.py* to create a working checkpoint. Run the *play.py* to test it. A 2D snake game will be rendered, where you can track the progress of the snake.

### You can modify the hyperparameters on your own if you are not happy with what is here. Not much hyperparameter tuning has been done on this.
